<a name="usage"></a>

2. Then you be asked to confirm that these are indeed the right values. 
    1. If you still enter the wrong values, the loading page will just be stuck as shown. 
    2. To re-enter the values, select "logout" from the hamburger menu

### b. Getting Client ID and Client Secret [&#8679;](#top)
The Spotify API requires the use of a *client ID* and a *client secret* to verify the app. Because I am a poor college student, I did not have money to spend on a serverüòê. So, here we are. This is, however, a one-time deal. Once you have loaded these into the app, you will no longer have to do it again!

1. Open the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Log in with your spotify account.
3. Click the "create an app" button.

4. The app name and description can be filled however you desire, but this is what I recommend: 
   1. App Name: "SpotiLy"
   2. App Description: "Get lyrics on an Electron-based GUI for the currently playing song on Spotify using the Genius API. (https://github.com/dhruvswarup123/SpotiLy)"
5. Click "Create"
6. In the app page, click settings.
<p align="center"><img src="resources/spotify_dash_main.png" width="500px"></p>


7. In the section marked "Redirect URIs", paste `http://localhost:8000/callback`, and click add.
<p align="center"><img src="resources/spotify_dash_setting.png" width="300px"></p>


8. Click "Save"
9.  Now copy and paste the client ID, and the client secret (after clicking "show client secret") into the app.

## Scope for Improvement [&#8679;](#top)
(This section includes known bugs in the program)
1. Adding synced lyrics
   1. This involves purchaing a plan from MusixMatch for access to the database with the timestamped lyrics
2. Hamburger Menu
   1. Add open on hover
   2. Close menu on clicking any div outside the menu.
