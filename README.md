## Getting Started [&#8679;](#top)
This section explains how to start and use the app, including how to obtain the *client ID* and the *client secret* values needed to login to Spotify's API.

<a name="usage"></a>
### a. How to Use? [&#8679;](#top)

1. On starting the app, the user will be prompted to enter the client_id and client_secret values. (See [this](#client))
<p align="center"><img src="resources/login.png" width="250"\></p>

2. The user will now be redirected to the spotify login page.
3. The app will now automatically load lyrics and display them, obviously, given that a song is indeed playing.
4. The song control buttons can be used to change tracks.

<a name="client"></a>
### b. Getting Client ID and Client Secret [&#8679;](#top)
The Spotify API requires the use of a *client ID* and a *client secret* to verify the app. Because I am a poor college student, I did not have money to spend on a serverüòê. So, here we are. This is, however, a one-time deal. Once these have been loaded into the app, it will not have to be done again.

1. Open the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Log in with a spotify account.
3. Click the "create an app" button.

4. The app name and description can be filled as desired, but this is what I recommend: 
   1. App Name: "SpotiLy"
   2. App Description: "Get lyrics on an Electron-based GUI for the currently playing song on Spotify using the Genius API. (https://github.com/dhruvswarup123/SpotiLy)"
5. Click "Create"
6. In the app page, click on "edit settings".
<p align="center"><img src="resources/spotify_dash_main.png" width="500px"></p>

7. In the section marked "Redirect URIs", paste `http://localhost:8000/callback`, and click add.
<p align="center"><img src="resources/spotify_dash_setting.png" width="300px"></p>

8. Click "Save"
9.  Now copy and paste the client ID, and the client secret (after clicking "show client secret") into the app.

### c. Troubleshooting [&#8679;](#top)
 If the wrong values for client id or client secret are entered, the loading page will be stuck as shown. To re-enter the values, select "logout" from the hamburger menu.

## Scope for Improvement [&#8679;](#top)
(This section includes known bugs in the program)
1. Adding synced lyrics
   1. This involves purchasing a plan from MusixMatch for access to the database with the timestamped lyrics
2. Hamburger Menu
   1. Add open on hover
   2. Close menu on clicking any div outside the menu.
